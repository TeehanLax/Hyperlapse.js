## Example

[Simple example](http://tllabs.io/hyperlapse/examples/simple.html)

```js
var hyperlapse = new Hyperlapse(document.getElementById('pano'), {
	lookat: new google.maps.LatLng(37.81409525128964,-122.4775045005249),
	zoom: 1,
	use_lookat: true,
	elevation: 50
});

hyperlapse.onError = function(e) {
	console.log(e);
};

hyperlapse.onRouteComplete = function(e) {
	hyperlapse.load();
};

hyperlapse.onLoadComplete = function(e) {
	hyperlapse.play();
};

// Google Maps API stuff here...
var directions_service = new google.maps.DirectionsService();

var route = {
	request:{
		origin: new google.maps.LatLng(37.816480000000006,-122.47825,37),
		destination: new google.maps.LatLng(37.81195,-122.47773000000001),
		travelMode: google.maps.DirectionsTravelMode.DRIVING
	}
};

directions_service.route(route.request, function(response, status) {
	if (status == google.maps.DirectionsStatus.OK) {
		hyperlapse.generate( {route:response} );
	} else {
		console.log(status);
	}
});
```
